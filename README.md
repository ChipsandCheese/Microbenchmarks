This is a final legacy release of a CnC-Tested and Reviewed build of clamchowder's microbenchmark suite.  All credit goes to clam.  The PowerPC portions are also attributed to Neggles, and the Loongson code is also attributed to cheese.

Going further, this will be placed in a legacy branch and only receive minor fixes and support.
