# Microbenchmarks
Nightly Branch for Chips and Cheese Microbenchmark collection.  At this point it's mostly still code from Clam and a bit from Cheese for PPC and loongson.  This will be updated more regularly but will not get any stability/quality guarantees.  Stable releases will follow in the future as the direction of the test suite is formally established and the repo is cleaned up to match.

#Building Clammicrobench with Generated Code
Get NASM (https://www.nasm.us/) and make sure it's in your path. Then things should build under Visual Studio 2019.

Some microbenchmarks have the source code and assembly generated by C# code, to avoid crazy stuff like self modifying code. For clammicrobench, build/run the AsmGen project. Pass "autocopy" on the command line to have it automatically place generated ASM files for Visual Studio. Then, the clammicrobench project should build.
