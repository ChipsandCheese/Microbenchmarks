# Microbenchmarks
Trying to figure various CPU things out

Basically my playground to microbenchmark various CPU-related things like ROB/register file sizes, lock/cache coherency latency, and cache/memory performance.

# Building
Get NASM (https://www.nasm.us/) and make sure it's in your path. Then things should build under Visual Studio 2019.

Some microbenchmarks have the source code and assembly generated by C# code, to avoid crazy stuff like self modifying code. For clammicrobench, build/run the ArmAsmGen project
(yeah I know the name needs to change as it generates x86 code as well) and copy the clammicrobench.cpp and clammicrobench_nasm.asm files into the clammicrobench project directory,
replacing the existing files there.
